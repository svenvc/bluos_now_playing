import Config

# config/runtime.exs is executed for all environments, including
# during releases. It is executed after compilation and before the
# system starts, so it is typically used to load production configuration
# and secrets from environment variables or elsewhere. Do not define
# any compile-time configuration in here, as it won't be applied.
# The block below contains prod specific runtime configuration.

# ## Using releases
#
# If you use `mix release`, you need to explicitly enable the server
# by passing the PHX_SERVER=true when you start it:
#
#     PHX_SERVER=true bin/bluos_now_playing start
#
# Alternatively, you can use `mix phx.gen.release` to generate a `bin/server`
# script that automatically sets the env var above.
#
# Burrito's launcher sets __BURRITO in the environment of the VM it starts, and
# it evaluates this file, so a standalone binary enables the server on its own
# and needs neither PHX_SERVER nor bin/server.
if System.get_env("PHX_SERVER") || System.get_env("__BURRITO") do
  config :bluos_now_playing, BluOSNowPlayingWeb.Endpoint, server: true

  # The secret key base is used to sign/encrypt cookies and other secrets.
  # A default value is used in config/dev.exs and config/test.exs but you
  # want to use a different value for prod and you most likely don't want
  # to check this value into version control, so we use an environment
  # variable instead.
  #
  # The fallback is what a standalone binary built by `mix release.burrito`
  # falls back to. It is a constant in every copy of that binary, which is
  # fine here: the app has no accounts, no sessions to trust and no
  # cross-origin protections to forge, and a person who can read the secret
  # out of the binary can read the same code and the same secret.
  # Plug.Conn requires at least 64 bytes of secret for its cookie store.

  # is IPv4 there, and IPv4 is what anything reaching this app on the network

  # ## SSL Support
  #
  # To get SSL working, you will need to add the `https` key
  # to your endpoint configuration:
  #
  #     config :bluos_now_playing, BluOSNowPlayingWeb.Endpoint,
  #       https: [
  #         ...,
  #         port: 443,
  #         cipher_suite: :strong,
  #         keyfile: System.get_env("SOME_APP_SSL_KEY_PATH"),
  #         certfile: System.get_env("SOME_APP_SSL_CERT_PATH")
  #       ]
  #
  # The `cipher_suite` is set to `:strong` to support only the
  # latest and more secure SSL ciphers. This means old browsers
  # and clients may not be supported. You can set it to
  # `:compatible` for wider support.
  #
  # `:keyfile` and `:certfile` expect an absolute path to the key
  # and cert in disk or a relative path inside priv, for example
  # "priv/ssl/server.key". For all supported SSL configuration
  # options, see https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.SSL.html#configure/1
  #
  # We also recommend setting `force_ssl` in your config/prod.exs,
  # ensuring no data is ever sent via http, always redirecting to https:
  #
  #     config :bluos_now_playing, BluOSNowPlayingWeb.Endpoint,
  #       force_ssl: [hsts: true]
  #
  # Check `Plug.SSL` for all available options in `force_ssl`.
